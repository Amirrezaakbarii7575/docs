# Share Modal

## Usage in React

Use this UI library to allow users to setup custom blockchain based access control. This library can be used in any React app.

## Usage in Vanilla JS (No React)

To use this library without React, you can use the following package, which wraps the react library up in vanilla JS.

## Usage in Next.js

Unfortunately, because NextJS forbids importing CSS modules in dependencies, this library cannot be used in NextJS natively. You must use the vanilla js project above, which will work fine with NextJS.
