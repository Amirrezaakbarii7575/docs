# Want to learn more about encrypting or decrypting content with Lit?

This example shows how to encrypt and decrypt a simple string. The SDK supports encrypting and decrypting files as well as encrypting files with metadata. 

Check out our [documentation](https://lit-protocol.github.io/lit-js-sdk/api_docs_html/) for more information.

## Examples of encrypting and decrypting in projects

Currently, [Lens Mandala](https://showcase.ethglobal.com/lfgrow/lens-mandala-t9jkr) is a good resource to check out. You can find their Lit implementation [here](https://github.com/crypto-mandala/lens-mandala/blob/main/lib/lit.ts).
