# What is Lit Protocol?

Lit Protocol is an open source, decentralized utility that uses encryption to provide blockchain users access to digital and real world experiences. 

Lit Protocol's main feature is a decentralized access control protocol running on top of EVM chains and Solana. With Lit, you can harness on-chain access control conditions to do 4 main things:

- Encrypt and lock static content (images, videos, music, etc) behind an on chain condition (for example, posession of an NFT).
- Decrypt static content that was locked behind an on chain condition.
- Authorize network signatures that provide access to dynamic content (for example, a server or network resource) behind an on chain condition.
- Request a network signed JWT that provisions access and authorization to dynamic content behind an on chain condition.

With this functionality, Lit Protocol enables the creation of locked NFTs that can only be unlocked by owners of that NFT. It also enables provisioning access to a given server or network resource only to NFT owners. Rather than a simple JPEG, Lit enabled NFTs can be HTML/JS/CSS web pages that can be interactive and dynamic.

## Features

- Supports many EVM chains and Solana. Full list here: https://developer.litprotocol.com/supportedChains
- Supports many standard contracts, with plans to support any RPC call soon. If you need to interact with a contract that we don't support yet, ask us, and we will implement it
- Boolean conditions. "And" or "Or" are currently supported.
- Updateable conditions. Only the creator can update the condition.
- Permanant conditions. When a condition is stored as permanant, it becomes impossible to update it, forever.
- Use your favorite storage solution including IPFS/Filecoin, Arweave, Sia, Storj, or even use centralized storage.
