# Lit Protocol Developer Docs

Lit (Lockable Interactive Token) Protocol is an open source, decentralized utility that uses encryption to provide blockchain users access to digital and real world experiences.

The network acts as a decentralized access control list (ACL) which leverages on-chain data to grant users access to content, software, and other decentralized networks.

Explore our guides and examples to integrate Lit.

## Lit for Encrypted Content

Configure Lit to grant blockchain users a systemic encryption key when they meet certain conditions on blockchains (e.g owning an NFT, being a member of a DAO) so they can decrypt content that is stored on decentralized or centralized storage.

## Lit for Dynamic Content

Configure Lit to grant users a network signed JWT when they meet blockchain based conditions and check the validity of this token with your server.

## Interactive NFTs

Create HTML NFTs contain an embedded React App thatâ€™s only accessible to the owner of the NFT

## Components

Use open source UI libraries to allow users to setup custom blockchain based access control.
