## Why?

Ceramic is amazing, but doesn't have read permissions on data. Everything is public. 

With Lit Protocol, you can specify who is able to decrypt and therefore read data based on on-chain conditions. This module allows you to integrate Ceramic with Lit.

For example, you could use this as your DB for a website for a DAO and specify that only DAO members can decrypt the data stored in Ceramic.

## Motivation

The goal of this project is to provide a decentralized fully serverless database solution with the ability to easily share private data. Ceramic is a great solution for the decentralized serverless database, but it doesn't have the ability to share private data on it's own. This module will allow you to share private data on Ceramic with the ability to specify who can decrypt the data.

## Code

You can find the NPM module here: https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/CeramicIntegration.

## [Ceramic Integration Guide](ceramicIntegration.mdx)

Build a simple web application encrypting and decrypting a string using Lit's Ceramic SDK. Check out the complete project [here](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/CeramicIntegrationExample).
