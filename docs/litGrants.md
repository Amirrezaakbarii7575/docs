 # Grants

[Lit Protocol Grants](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/LitGrants)

The Lit grant program is looking to fund projects that improve developer experience and community development in the web3 ecosystem. We want to support those who are building the infrastructure and applications that will make it easier for people to use and develop Lit-enabled applications.
