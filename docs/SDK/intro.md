# Intro to the Lit SDK
## With the Lit SDK you can interact with the Lit network by:

### Encrypting Static Content (images, videos, music, documents, etc)

Configure Lit to grant blockchain users a symmetric encryption key when they meet certain conditions on blockchains (e.g owning an NFT, being a member of a DAO) so they can decrypt content that is stored on any decentralized or centralized storage platform.

### Gate Access to Dynamic Content

Configure Lit to grant users a network signed JWT when they meet blockchain based conditions and check the validity of this token with your server.

### Creating Interactive HTML NFTs

Create HTML NFTs that contain embedded HTML/JS/CSS thatâ€™s only accessible to the owner of the NFT.

## Examples
You can find reference implementations of the above examples [here](https://developer.litprotocol.com/docs/ExamplesAndGuides/SDKExamples/EncryptAndDecrypt/installation).
