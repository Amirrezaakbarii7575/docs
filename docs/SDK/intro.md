# Intro

The Lit JS SDK is a javascript SDK and can be found here: https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/lit-js-sdk

With the JS SDK you can interact with the Lit network. You can use the JS SDK to:

## Encrypt Static Content (images, videos, music, documents, etc)

Configure Lit to grant blockchain users a symmetric encryption key when they meet certain conditions on blockchains (e.g owning an NFT, being a member of a DAO) so they can decrypt content that is stored on any decentralized or centralized storage platform.

## Gate Access to Dynamic Content

Configure Lit to grant users a network signed JWT when they meet blockchain based conditions and check the validity of this token with your server.

## Create Interactive HTML NFTs

Create HTML NFTs that contain embedded HTML/JS/CSS thatâ€™s only accessible to the owner of the NFT
