# JS SDK

The Lit JS SDK is a javascript SDK and can be found here: https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/lit-js-sdk

## Lit for Encrypted Content

Configure Lit to grant blockchain users a systemic encryption key when they meet certain conditions on blockchains (e.g owning an NFT, being a member of a DAO) so they can decrypt content that is stored on decentralized or centralized storage.

## Lit for Dynamic Content

Configure Lit to grant users a network signed JWT when they meet blockchain based conditions and check the validity of this token with your server.

## Interactive NFTs

Create HTML NFTs contain an embedded React App thatâ€™s only accessible to the owner of the NFT
