# Additional Integrations

## JS JWT Verifier

If you just want to verify Lit JWTs, you can use this lightweight JS library to do it: https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/lit-jwt-verifier

If you're looking to do anything more complex, you'll need to use the Lit JS SDK to do it.

## Oauth Integrations

We've created oauth integrations with Zoom and Google Drive to provide the ability to protect Zoom meetings or Google Drive files using Lit Protocol.

Check out our code to see how it works
