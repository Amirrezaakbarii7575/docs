# Introduction to Decentralized Access Control
Lit Protocol provides decentralized access control but what does that actually mean? 

With Lit Protocol, you can set on-chain conditions like "user must hold an NFT" and then the network will provision signatures and decryption keys for users that meet those conditions.

## On-chain conditions and credentials are things like:
* User is a member of a DAO
* User holds an NFT in a collection
* User holds at least 0.1 ETH
* The result of any smart contract function call
* User owns a specific wallet address
* Using boolean operations (AND + OR) for any of the above

## Tools for Access Control Condition
The [Lit Share Modal v3](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/lit-share-modal-v3) is a tool for creating access control conditions for securing content with Lit Protocol.
